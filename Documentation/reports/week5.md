# Week 5 report

## What have you done this week?
I wrote class for lambertian material (diffuse) and 
made some optimizations to multithreading. The raytracer 
now supports recursive scatter rays. I've also began to 
write implementation and testing documents. 
## How has the project progressed?
The project has progressed as expected. 

## What did you learn this week / today?
Read material about monte carlo path tracing. More 
specifically on how monte carlo integration works. 
I've also been introduced to the "rendering equation".


## What has been inclear or problematic? Please answer this question truthfully, as this is something the course assistant may be able to help with.
No problems so far.

## What next?
Starting to implement bounding volume hierarchy 
which is heap like data structure. After implementing 
bvh maybe support for 3D models or area lights or
texture mapping.
