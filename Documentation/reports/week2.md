# Week 2 report

## What have you done this week?
I set up googletests (unit testing), 
codecov.io test coverage raports, travis CI and  doxygen documentation to the project. 
First few lines of the actual code 
has been written too.
## How has the project progressed?
Testing out the different unit testing frameworks took longer than expected,
which means I'm slightly behind the schedule. 
## What did you learn this week / today?
I learned how to set up all the things mentioned in the first question and some things about specific gcc-compiler flags. 
## What has been inclear or problematic? Please answer this question truthfully, as this is something the course assistant may be able to help with.
All the problems I had previously are solved and no new problems have emerged. 
## What next?
The actual coding part begins.
