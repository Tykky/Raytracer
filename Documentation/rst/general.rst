Building the project
######################

If your system has all the required depedencies you should be
able to clone and build the project with:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/Tykky/Raytracer --recursive
    cd raytracer
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    cmake --build . --config release

.. note::
    OpenGL capable graphics card is required to run and build the project with GUI.
    If you don't have one, make sure to build the project with CMake option -DBUILD_GUI=OFF

.. note::
    OpenMP capable compiler is required in order to the parallelization to work. 
    The program should compile in single threaded mode if OpenMP is not available.

After building the executables can be found in

.. code-block:: bash

    raytracer/build/bin

The project can be built without GUI by using

.. code-block:: bash

    cmake -DBUILD_GUI=OFF ..
    cmake --build . --config release

and without tests by using

.. code-block:: bash

    cmake -DBUILD_TEST=OFF ..
    cmake --build . --config release

Building the documentation
#############################

The documentation is built with Doxygen and Sphinx. 
Doxygen is used to produce API documentation from 
comments in the source code (which produces xml files)
and Sphinx is used to read the xml and produce 
the documentation. Breathe is extension to Sphinx which 
makes Sphinx understand Doxygen xml output and Exhale 
adds automatic API document generation. 

Navigate to Documents folder

.. code-block::

    cd Documentation

Generate sphinx html files (Linux)

.. code-block::

    make html

Generate sphinx html files (Windows)

.. code-block::

    .\make.bat html
